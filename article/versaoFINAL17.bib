abstract={Vehicular communications is an important enabler for enhancing the safety on roads by supporting mutual awareness of vehicles as well as for improving the efficiency of transportation through smart traffic management by intelligent transport systems (ITSs). Governments around the world have set ambitious goals for road fatality reduction in the near future; e.g., the European Union targets a 50% reduction of road fatalities by 2020 as compared to the year 2010. Furthermore, traffic telematic systems aim to minimize the environmental impact of transportation and maximize the utilization of available road infrastructure by adaptive traffic management. To realize these challenging targets, autonomous wireless information exchange among vehicles-vehicle to vehicle (V2V)-and with roadside infrastructure-vehicle to infrastructure (V2I)-are central ingredients. In addition to traffic efficiency and safety-related issues, vehicular communications is increasingly recognized as an important revenue driver by car manufacturing companies since it enables wirelessly connected in-vehicle entertainment systems that support on-demand video streaming and online Internet access for passengers. Also, in the future, machine-type communication is expected to play a major role in vehicular environments, with more sensors that monitor the internal state of vehicles and autonomously exchange service and maintenance information with cloud servers of manufacturers. Depending on the considered use-case, distinct quality of service (QoS) requirements come into play [1]: infotainment applications for in-car users require high bandwidth and network capacity, active road safety relies on delay- and outage-critical data transmission, whereas information exchange for road traffic efficiency management typically comes without strict QoS requirements and exhibits graceful degradation of performance with increasing latency.},

Consequently, complexity of the automotive electronic system inside the vehicles are daily increasing. To guarantee the safe operation of vehicles, it is of great significance to acquire vehicle data in real-time to realize the on-line diagnosis, cybersecurity attacking detection and et al. In this paper, we propose to realize a STM32-based data acquisition system(DAS), where the vehicle data transferred on CAN networks are acquired through the OBD2(On-Broad Diagnosis) interface. And then, the acquired vehicle data are parsed and analyzed preliminarily according to the OBD2 protocol, and then shown on a LED displayer. Through the implementation of a prototype system, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed design of DAS is verified.},

abstract={As wireless and telecommunicaton infrastructure communications have been integrated into modern vehicle systems (i.e., infotainment systems and vehicle to vehicle systems), the security implications on the relatively unchanged underlying network protocols inside the vehicles are investigated by researchers and industrial experts in the corresponding domain. Some researchers have achieved the investigation by using actual vehicles or vehicle components, and although this is an effective way to produce an accurate testing environment it provides little or no flexibility in its configuration. In this work, we produce a testbed architecture for vehicle security investigation that not only can reproduce the complexity of numerous vehicle control units running at real time inside the vehicle CAN bus, but is also reconfigurable giving the testbed the ability to replicate various test configurations. We create a prototype of the testbed and conduct an experiment to demonstrate a new type of security attack through an infotainment gateway in the testbed, the source code of the prototype and the test data of the experiment are all uploaded for sharing.},

abstract={Despite the fact that numerous studies have indicated that vehicular networks are vulnerable to external and internal attacks, very little effort has been expended in safeguarding communications both between elements within the vehicle and between the vehicle and the outside world. In this paper we present a mechanism that allows communications policy (essentially who can talk with whom and the security parameters of the channel) to be defined during the design of the software component and then adapted as the component undergoes integration first within subsystems and so on all the way to the final integration in the operational vehicle. We provide a mechanism that can maintain the integrity of the policy throughout the development effort and, finally, enforce the policy during the operation of the component in the production vehicle.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength Ω becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system ω. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 × 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few (<;100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled (Ω/ω- ||},

abstract={This paper considers the problem of diagnosing people's driving skills under real driving conditions using GPS data and video records. For this real environment implementation, a brand new intelligent driving diagnosis system based on fuzzy logic was developed. This system seeks to propose an abstraction of expert driving criteria for driving assessment. The analysis takes into account GPS signals such as: position, velocity, accelerations and vehicle yaw angle; because of its relation with drivers' maneuvers. In that sense, this work presents in the first place, the proposed scheme for the intelligent driving diagnosis agent in terms of its own characteristics properties, which explain important considerations about how an intelligent agent must be conceived. Secondly, it attempts to explain the scheme for the implementation of the intelligent driving diagnosis agent based on its fuzzy logic algorithm, which takes into account the analysis of real-time telemetry signals and proposed set of driving diagnosis rules for the intelligent driving diagnosis, based on a quantitative abstraction of some traffic laws and some secure driving techniques. Experimental testing has been performed in driving conditions. All tested drivers performed the driving task on real streets. The testing results show that our intelligent driving diagnosis system allows quantitative qualifications of driving performance with a high degree of reliability.},

  abstract  = {A massive research effort is recently going in the direction of interfacing cars with smartphones to offer value-added services to driver and passengers. Such an interest is motivated by the large popularity of smartphones and by the observation that vehicles can act as effective collectors of information from the surrounding environment. Indeed, modern cars are endowed with several sensors forming an in-vehicle network, which provides kinematics information, automotive diagnostic services, etc. Cars can be further equipped with external sensing devices to monitor specific physical parameters, such as pollution, humidity, temperature, etc. If properly collected and delivered, such data can contribute to make the road transport greener, smarter, and safer. With the purpose of supporting and improving data collection and distribution, in this paper a smartphone-based platform is designed that exploits low-cost dedicated hardware to interact with sensors on board and in the vehicle surroundings. Retrieved data are classified and then opportunistically transmitted via the most convenient wireless interface to the specific remote control and monitoring center. A prototype is also developed to assess the technological feasibility of our conceived platform.},

An accurate analysis of the collected data has been performed to identify the main parameters able to monitor driver behavior and to define suitable indexes to evaluate the driving performance. Particular attention has been paid to the analysis of vehicle parameters during braking and gear shifting in order to classify different attitudes and generate driver profiles and trends. Understanding drivers’ characteristic behavior can contribute significantly to road safety, to define insurance premium, to engage user in saving fuel and money and to correlate faults of the car with the driving style.},

abstract={Telematics is an eminent technology which merges telecommunications and informatics. This blending of wireless telecommunication technologies along with computers is done ostensibly with the goal of conveying information over vast networks to handle vehicle information. The entire system consists of TeCU Telematics Control Unit, server and Web page application to monitor and to sense ample information's received from vehicle over the air. Telematics Control Unit (TeCU) has to be designed and developed, which could be used in real time and off time monitoring, tracking and reporting system. TeCU is mounted in the vehicles and it's implemented with GSM/GPRS for tracking to communicate with server. The user can create a webpage application and monitor the vehicle update information's and mappings with fine precision. Thus, system provides adequate information to fleet operator regarding route/direction taken by driver, stoppages, high acceleration, vehicle location, speed, idle mode, AC ON or OFF, vehicles unit information's, RPM, sudden braking, date, time, etc. All these vehicle information's from TeCU could be updated to the Server; this is possible through GPRS communication. Thus server dispatch's all information's completely to end user Web page. This system could be extensively used in commercial vehicles and in constant equipments. In this paper fuel sensor and TeCU is interfaced, and then fuel status of vehicle is monitored predominantly on the Web page. Then the implementations will be done to administrate the system. This core endeavor of the paper is to identify and manage the fuel pilfering.},

abstract={Drowsy driving is one of the main reasons of road accidents. Different techniques have been reported in literature to detect driver's drowsiness, but almost all the prevailing systems only alert the driver if drowsiness is detected. Consequently, the drowsy driver continues driving, with a high risk of devastating accident. In this paper, we proposed and verified an EEG based system which not only alerts the driver by alarm, but also puts the vehicle in semiautomatic parking mode by controlling fuel supply if drowsiness is detected. At the same time, it reports nearby police station by SMS which contains necessary information to take essential steps locating the vehicle. Stored EEG signals, obtained with wireless wearable headsets from numerous subjects in different conditions by different research groups, were used in this work. Power spectrum analyses were carried out in MATLAB to determine the dominant frequency components in the brain signals. The slow wave to fast wave ratios of EEG activities were assessed for a number of epochs to determine driver's drowsiness. GPS and GSM modules were used with Arduino MEGA for tracking, remote notification and servomotor control. Performance of the proposed system was evaluated by stored data which confirmed its feasibility and reliability.},

In this study, we explore a driver drowsiness monitoring and early warning system, which uses machine learning techniques based on vehicle telemetry data. The proposed system can ensure safe driving by real time monitoring of driving pattern. This proves to be a very cost effective technique over biometric and camera based techniques since it doesn't involve expensive sensors. The detection of drowsy state of a driver is modeled as a binary classification issue. We outline the design methodology followed and challenges faced in developing a machine learning based classification scheme on vehicle telemetry data, which is essentially a time-series data. Even though our study is focused on an exemplary application like driver attention monitoring, the results can be equally applied for vehicle prognostics, driving style analytics and various other telematics applications in automotive industry.

abstract={The increasing number of accidents in transportation (rail, road) recorded in the past few years have become a serious concern for the society. The accidents caused by driving under fatigue, drowsiness and disruptive (stress) factors have a high mortality rate due to decreasing of the abilities of perception, recognition and control which are necessary for the conductors in the field of road and railway. The paper proposes a multi-sensor system for predicting fatigue and drowsiness based on the analysis of the power spectrum density (PSD) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and correlation with the cardiac cycle (ECG) or with the respiratory cycle. EEG data collecting uses a sensorial system, headset type (physical contact) or capacitive (no physical contact), and for ECG data collecting a new system of sensor is proposed, that does not involve physical contact against the capacitive system currently used. Our results demonstrated that it is possible to estimate with quantitative accuracy the driving performance in a 3D driving simulator, using the multi-sensor system proposed.},

abstract={Battery electric vehicles (BEV) are envisioned to play a significant role in the future of personal mobility. A key challenge in the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) powered vehicles to BEV is the limited driving range of the latter, which makes an energy-efficient operation essential. In this work, we analyze how vehicle-to-x (V2X) communication, in particular traffic-light-to-vehicle communication (TLVC), can help the drivers of BEVs save energy and thus increase driving range. Furthermore, we analyze factors impacting energy consumption which are relevant to the design of V2X applications for BEV. Our results indicate that TLVC can significantly reduce the energy consumption of BEV, up to 20% in our setup. The actual result, however, is highly dependent on a combination of traffic situation, communication range, auxiliary consumer power demand, road gradient and minimum speed requirement.},

abstract={This paper reports the development of vehicle fuel flow estimation algorithms based entirely on signals available through the standard OBD-II interface. The paper also illustrates the use of the resulting fuel flow estimates for adaptation and optimization. The fuel flow estimation algorithm functionality differs depending on the powertrain type (gasoline versus diesel, naturally aspirated versus boosted, conventional versus hybrid electric, etc.). To facilitate fuel and time efficient vehicle routing, an adaptation algorithm based on the recursive least squares (Kalman filtering) is defined. This adaptation algorithm learns the expected values and the variances of fuel consumption and travel time from multiple drives of a given vehicle over a given route segment. The use of adaptation from data reduces the need for accurate predictive modeling of vehicle fuel consumption and travel time which depend on difficult to predict and incorporate into the model traffic conditions, topographical road information, weather conditions, and inherently present vehicle-to-vehicle, driver-to-driver and fuel variability. The use of the adaptive models for optimization of vehicle travel is showcased with a simple example of optimizing time of day of departure decisions for a service vehicle. Finally, the use of a large interconnected network of adaptive models for vehicle fleet operation optimization is discussed.},

Pollution has always been a factor of concern in an era where global warming is considered to be a huge danger to mankind. The existing system in controlling such pollution occurring through vehicular emission is governed by fuel and emission control and it is done by manual parameters for every vehicle in regular intervals.

abstract={“Smart” vehicles of the future are envisioned to aid their drivers in reducing fuel consumption and emissions by wirelessly receiving phase-shifting information of the traffic lights in their vicinity and computing an optimized speed in order to avoid braking and acceleration maneuvers. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential environmental benefit in small-scale simulation scenarios. To assess the overall benefit, large-scale simulations are required. In order to ensure computational feasibility, the applied simulation models need to be simplified as far as possible without sacrificing credibility. Therefore this work presents the results of a sensitivity analysis and identifies gear choice and the distance from the traffic light at which vehicles are informed as key influencing factors. Our results indicate that a suboptimal gear choice can void the benefits of the speed adaptation. Furthermore, we present first results of a scale-up simulation using a real-world inner-city road network and discuss the range in which we expect the saving in fuel consumption to be in reality.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a fuzzy-tuned equivalent consumption minimization strategy (F-ECMS) is proposed as an intelligent real-time energy management solution for a conceptual diesel engine-equipped heavy duty hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). In the HEV, two electric motors/generators are mounted on the turbocharger shaft and engine shaft, respectively, which can improve fuel efficiency by capturing and storing energy from both regenerative braking and otherwise wasted engine exhaust gas. The heavy duty HEV frequently involved in duty cycles characterized by start-stop events, especially in off-road applications, whose dynamics is analyzed in this paper. The on-line optimization problem is formulated as minimizing a cost function in terms of weighted fuel power and electric power. In the cost function, a cost factor is defined for both improving energy transmission efficiency and maintaining the battery energy balance. To deal with the nonexplicit relationship between HEV fuel economy, battery state of charge (SOC), and control variables, the cost factor is fuzzy tuned using expert knowledge and experience. In relation to the fuel economy, the air-fuel ratio is an important factor. An online search for capable optimal variable geometry turbocharger (VGT) vane opening and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve opening is also necessary. Considering the exhaust emissions regulation in diesel engine control, the boundary values of VGT and EGR actuators are identified by offline design-of-experiment tests. An online rolling method is used to implement the multivariable optimization. The proposed method is validated via simulation under two transient driving cycles, with the fuel economy benefits of 4.43% and 6.44% over the nonhybrid mode, respectively. Compared with the telemetry equivalent consumption minimization strategy, the proposed F-ECMS shows better performance in the sustainability of battery SOC under driving conditions with the rapid dynamics often associated with off-r- ad applications.},

abstract={Transport companies are probably one of the greatest sources of pollution nowadays. Perhaps because these companies would like to improve this situation, or perhaps because they simply would like to reduce the petrol they consume, they are more than ever deploying plans in order to increase the efficiency of their fleets. One of the easiest and cheapest ways to achieve this is to teach their drivers how to be more efficient. Nevertheless, traditional learning approaches were only successful in the short term, according to the previous work. In order to achieve long-term results, new learning paradigms must be taken into account. Furthermore, if we combine these paradigms with a learning analytics system, optimal results may be reached for both the company and the drivers. In this paper, we present a learning analytics system applied to the efficient driving context. This learning analytics system is used as a fundamental piece in the deployment of the blended learning methodology for efficient professional driving designed by our research group. We describe the design and the integration of this system with a real product currently being used in many transport fleets. With a technical approach, we also describe the main problems found during the deployment of this system and the solutions designed to cope with these problems.},

abstract={This paper considers the problem of characterize the way people drive applied to driver assistance systems without using direct driver signals. To make this, was developed an intelligent driving diagnosis system based on neural networks [2]. This take into account signals that can be acquired by a GPS data logging system: position, velocity, accelerations and steering angle. Now, are presented two approaches based on this intelligent driving diagnosis system. The first, propose to identify potential high risk areas on the road taking into account the average rate of diagnosis in each signal on the road. The second, present the structure of a driver model based on neural networks and using as inputs statistical transformations of the driving diagnosis time signals: inadequate steering and pedals inputs, speeding and road or lane departure. The validation of this model is developed in two applications: driver identification and driver classification (good or bad). In addition, an architecture based on fuzzy logic for real environment implementation is presented. System performance was tested in a driving simulation system [13]. Results presented in this paper shows that our intelligent driving diagnosis system allows to identify potential high risk locations on roads, and also is able to classify different kinds of drivers with a high degree of reliability.},

abstract={This paper developed a speech controlled interface for vehicle on-board diagnostic (OBD) system. The proposed vehicle OBD system contains three parts. They are OBD embedded global position system (GPS-OBD) module, speech controlled interface, and vehicle surveillance server. The GPSOBD module is designed to monitor the real-time location as well as operation information of vehicle. The real-time location information contains driving date, driving time, longitude, and latitude obtained from GPS receiver. In addition to these-real time location information obtained from GPS receiver, the GPS-OBD module can also record the real-time vehicle operation information, e.g., vehicle speed, engine rpm, coolant temperature, battery voltage, fault code number, and others from OBD system. Both of the real-time location and operation information will be uploaded to the vehicle surveillance server via 3.5G wireless network. At the same time, the speech controlled interface can be used to operate the GPS-OBD module. The GPS-OBD module can recognize speech commands and make proper responses in text-to-speech (TTS) format to the drivers. The derivers therefore could safely operate the proposed system without removing their eyes from the road. The vehicle surveillance server is designed to receive and record the real-time vehicle information. The authorized supervisors or servicemen can use this server to access the state of vehicle in the real time. The proposed system is very useful for the detection of vehicle pollution, warning of vehicle malfunction, remote diagnosis, and roadside repair.},

Comparisons are done in terms of selected Figures of Merit (FoM) that are commonly employed as metrics for classifying driving style.

abstract={Being able automatically recognize the driving style is a very important and challenging task with many practical applications, including insurance. Note that hand labelling of the driving trajectories represents a very time-consuming task. To overcome this problem, we can reduce thousands of variable-length trajectories to the traditional rectangular format, using quantile-based technique. After that we can apply standard classifier to compare trajectories, corresponding to the particular driver, with trajectories of a few randomly selected drivers. We are assuming here that the most of the drivers have safe driving style with similar statistical characteristics. By comparing the current driver with a few randomly selected “good” drivers, we estimate the probability that the current driver is bad (or has significant deviations from usual statistical characteristics). Note as a distinguished particular feature of the presented method: it does not require availability of the training labels. The database includes 2736 drivers with 200 variable length driving trajectories each. We tested our model (with competitive results) online during Kaggle-based AXA Drivers Telematics Challenge in 2015.},

abstract={Driver drowsiness and distraction are two main reasons for traffic accidents and the related financial losses. Therefore, researchers have been working for more than a decade on designing driver inattention monitoring systems. As a result, several detection techniques for the detection of both drowsiness and distraction have been proposed in the literature. Some of these techniques were successfully adopted and implemented by the leading car companies. This paper discusses and provides a comprehensive insight into the well-established techniques for driver inattention monitoring and introduces the use of most recent and futuristic solutions exploiting mobile technologies such as smartphones and wearable devices. Then, a proposal is made for the active of such systems into car-to-car communication to support vehicular ad hoc network's (VANET's) primary aim of safe driving. We call this approach the dissemination of driver behavior via C2C communication. Throughout this paper, the most remarkable studies of the last five years were examined thoroughly in order to reveal the recent driver monitoring techniques and demonstrate the basic pros and cons. In addition, the studies were categorized into two groups: driver drowsiness and distraction. Then, research on the driver drowsiness was further divided into two main subgroups based on the exploitation of either visual features or nonvisual features. A comprehensive compilation, including used features, classification methods, accuracy rates, system parameters, and environmental details, was represented as tables to highlight the (dis)advantages and/or limitations of the aforementioned categories. A similar approach was also taken for the methods used for the detection of driver distraction.},

In particular, smartphones can be used as driving sensors to identify individual driver behavior and risky maneuvers. However, in order to estimate driver behavior with smartphones, the system must deal with different vehicle characteristics. This is the main limitation of existing sensing platforms, which are principally based on fixed thresholds for different sensing parameters. In this paper, we propose an adaptive driving maneuver detection mechanism that iteratively builds a statistical model of the driver, vehicle, and smartphone combination using a multivariate normal model. By means of experimentation over a test track and public roads, we first explore the capacity of different sensor input combinations to detect risky driving maneuvers, and we propose a training mechanism that adapts the profiling model to the vehicle, driver, and road topology. A large-scale evaluation study is conducted, showing that the model for maneuver detection and scoring is able to adapt to different drivers, vehicles, and road conditions.},

abstract = "Abstract The advent of the Internet of Things enables companies to collect an increasing amount of sensor generated data which creates plenty of new business opportunities. This study investigates how this sensor data can improve the risk selection process in an insurance company. More specifically, several risk assessment models based on three different data mining techniques are augmented with driving behaviour data collected from In-Vehicle Data Recorders. This study proves that including standard telematics variables significantly improves the risk assessment of customers. As a result, insurers will be better able to tailor their products to the customers' risk profile. Moreover, this research illustrates the importance of including industry knowledge, combined with data expertise, in the variable creation process. Especially when a regulator forces the use of easily interpretable data mining techniques, expert-based telematics variables are able to improve the risk assessment model in addition to the standard telematics variables. Further, the results suggest that if a manager wants to implement Usage-Based-Insurances, Pay-As-You-Drive related variables are most valuable to tailor the premium to the risk. Finally, the study illustrates that this new type of telematics-based insurance product can quickly be implemented since three months of data is already sufficient to obtain the best risk estimations."

Development of advanced information and communication systems, significant drop in the technology cost of ownership, as well as the necessity for market differentiation in the insurance industry, facilitated the appearance of new billing models in the motor insurance industry. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate underlying principles of the technology facilitating new billing models in the motor insurance industry. This paper gives an overview of the system architecture of one of the telematics systems offered and used on the market, as well as the data model used in the billing process. The potential of such a system is demonstrated through the real case project implemented in Eastern Europe."

  abstract  = {Insurance telematics is a disruptive technology that is expected to reform the vehicle insurance industry. Based on sensor data, the traditional measures for calculating the insurance premium are complemented to determine a fee that more accurately predicts the risk profile of the policyholder. From an instrumentation and measurement point of view, there are several insurance telematics challenges that have to be tackled. It is about consistently extracting relevant figures of merit (FoMs) like number of harsh braking, speeding, heavy cornering, trip smoothness, etc, and then to transform these FoMs into a valid measure, or score, that determines the risk profile of the insurance customer. The paper presents a characterization of FoMs in terms of actuarial relevance, the driver's influence, stationarity and observability, which are important for the given task. Dedicated hardware to be fitted into the on-board diagnostics outlet as well as contemporary smartphones are two different insurance telematics platforms for data collection. The paper discusses the properties of the smartphone in the perspective of insurance telematics as a low-cost alternative to the hardwired platforms like the one connected to the vehicle's on-board diagnostics outlet.},

abstract={We propose a framework for the detection of dangerous vehicle cornering events, based on statistics related to the no-sliding and no-rollover conditions. The input variables are estimated using an unscented Kalman filter applied to global navigation satellite system (GNSS) measurements of position, speed, and bearing. The resulting test statistic is evaluated in a field study where three smartphones are used as measurement probes. A general framework for performance evaluation and estimator calibration is presented as depending on a generic loss function. Furthermore, we introduce loss functions designed for applications aiming to either minimize the number of missed detections and false alarms, or to estimate the risk level in each cornering event. Finally, the performance characteristics of the estimator are presented as depending on the detection threshold, as well as on design parameters describing the driving behavior. Since the estimation only uses GNSS measurements, the framework is particularly well suited for smartphone-based insurance telematics applications, aiming to avoid the logistic and monetary costs associated with, e.g., on-board-diagnostics or black-box dependent solutions. The design of the estimation algorithm allows for instant feedback to be given to the driver and, hence, supports the inclusion of real-time value-added services in usage-based insurance programs.},

Finding certain kinds of driving styles, or risk modes from raw data for insured vehicles, is very important for the insurance companies to get a rough understand of the types of each contract holders and to do the preliminary premium actuary work. Consider that there is a lack of theory basis for driving styles, or risk modes identification and their effect analysis in quantity, in this paper, in order to quantify the effect of different risk modes, and consider that the effect evaluation might be under fuzzy or uncertainty conditions, a fuzzy risk mode and effect analysis (FRMEA) method which can be applied in the early stage of premium actuary for PHYD insurance product is proposed, by setting 4 key indices including occurrence, severity, testability and preventability, and by referencing the grading results from a group of experts, the effect grades of several different risk modes have been given and described via fuzzy triangular numbers.},

  abstract = {Abstract Vehicular networking has become a significant research area due to its specific features and applications such as standardization, efficient traffic management, road safety and infotainment. Vehicles are expected to carry relatively more communication systems, on board computing facilities, storage and increased sensing power. Hence, several technologies have been deployed to maintain and promote Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Recently, a number of solutions were proposed to address the challenges and issues of vehicular networks. Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) is one of the solutions. VCC is a new hybrid technology that has a remarkable impact on traffic management and road safety by instantly using vehicular resources, such as computing, storage and internet for decision making. This paper presents the state-of-the-art survey of vehicular cloud computing. Moreover, we present a taxonomy for vehicular cloud in which special attention has been devoted to the extensive applications, cloud formations, key management, inter cloud communication systems, and broad aspects of privacy and security issues. Through an extensive review of the literature, we design an architecture for VCC, itemize the properties required in vehicular cloud that support this model. We compare this mechanism with normal Cloud Computing (CC) and discuss open research issues and future directions. By reviewing and analyzing literature, we found that VCC is a technologically feasible and economically viable technological shifting paradigm for converging intelligent vehicular networks towards autonomous traffic, vehicle control and perception systems.},

Among many areas associated with the Internet of Things, smart grid and electric vehilces have their share of this challenge by being both producers and consumers (ie., prosumers) of big data. Electric vehicls can significantly help smart cities to become greener by reducing emissions of the transportation sector and play an important role in green smart cities. In this article, we first survey the data analytics techniques used for handling the big data of smart grid and electric vehicles. The data generated by electric vehicles come from sources that vary from sensors to trip logs. Once this vast amount of data are analyzed using big data techniques, they can be used to develop policies for siting charging stations, developing smart charging algorithms, solving energy efficiency issues, evaluating the capacity of power distribution systems to handle extra charging loads, and finally, determining the market value for the services provided by electric vehicles (i.e., vehicle-to-grid opportunities). This article provides a comprehensive overview of the data analytics landscape on the electric vehicle integration to green smart cities. It serves as a roadmap to the future data analytics needs and solutions for electric vehicle integration to smart cities.},

abstract={Current farming practices try to reduce soil compaction, carbon-dioxide emission, fuel consumption and to fulfill further environmental goals. Another goal of current farming practices is to minimize the duration for handling a field, in order to become independent of extreme weather conditions. Such environmental and economic goals may be met through increased automation and robotization in agriculture. As known from the industrial sector, automation and robotization is based on reliable communication. On implementing this in agriculture, an important prerequisite for the coordination of farm vehicles are real-time wireless networks. Such networks have to fulfill the demands of real-time systems and take into account the characteristics of mobile vehicles and groups of vehicles with their special mobility patterns and radio environment. We present a new approach for soft real-time networks based on IEEE 802.11. Our idea is the use of available sensory information like the signal strength of transmitters and relative position of vehicles in order to predict the real-time service quality for moving agricultural vehicles. We prototypically implement our method on board of two agricultural vehicles. Finally, we evaluate and discuss the results for agricultural usage and propose further improvements.},

Now, vehicles can easily exchange safety, efficiency, infotainment, and comfort-related information with other vehicles and infrastructures using vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). We leverage on the cloud-based VANETs theme to propose cyber-physical architecture for the Social IoV (SIoV). SIoV is a vehicular instance of the Social IoT (SIoT), where vehicles are the key social entities in the machine-to-machine vehicular social networks. We have identified the social structures of SIoV components, their relationships, and the interaction types.

abstract={In order to have safe vehicular traffic across the expressway a real-time monitoring has become a vital need for the today's intelligent traffic monitoring systems(ITS). In this paper we present a design and development of low cost and reliable Internet of things framework which consists of an array of RFID sensors for the real time tracking of the vehicle on its transit from one point to other point of the high speed expressway. The uniquely detecting capability of vehicle using RFID sensor network makes it a better choice compared to the image processing based systems. In this project a real-time stamps are taken from the array of RFID sensor network and the velocity of the vehicle is approximated in the real-time environment using Euler's algorithms. Here an Arduino platform with an Ethernet connection can be used as a core controller and the resultant data can be viewed on the internet using cloud computing.},

abstract={Facilitated by the emerging technologies of cloud computing, vehicular cloud computing (VCC) is being expected to be a new paradigm to create a new situation for vehicular data services. However, with the increasing popularity of vehicular cloud services, accessing vehicular terminals and produced mobile data are experiencing tremendous growth, therefore, how to provide enough capacity for all access requirements and handle all the mobile data traffic to address the challenges posed by richer vehicular applications are critical. In future 5G mobile networks, promoted by the advantages of supporting various connectivity and significantly faster transmission performance of 5G communications, VCC will be enabled to provide more realistic vehicular data cloud services. In this article, an innovative VCC platform with the support of 5G communications for providing effective vehicular data cloud services is first proposed. Then, in this context, a vehicular social-based taxi-sharing cloud service is mainly investigated. Finally, some open issues and challenges with possible solutions for future work are discussed.},

This article especially examines how VANET evolves with two emerging paradigms: vehicular cloud computing and information-centric networking. VCC brings the mobile cloud model to vehicular networks and thus changes the way of network service provisioning, whereas ICN changes the notion of data routing and dissemination. We envision a new vehicular networking system, vehicular cloud networking, on top of them. This article scrutinizes its architecture and operations, and discusses its design principles.},

In a VC, underutilized vehicular resources including computing power, storage, and Internet connectivity can be shared between drivers or rented out over the Internet to various customers. Clearly, if the VC concept is to see a wide adoption and to have significant societal impact, security and privacy issues need to be addressed. The main contribution of this work is to identify and analyze a number of security challenges and potential privacy threats in VCs. Although security issues have received attention in cloud computing and vehicular networks, we identify security challenges that are specific to VCs, e.g., challenges of authentication of high-mobility vehicles, scalability and single interface, tangled identities and locations, and the complexity of establishing trust relationships among multiple players caused by intermittent short-range communications. Additionally, we provide a security scheme that addresses several of the challenges discussed.},

This paper introduces the future emerging technology, i.e., Vehicular Cloud Networking (VCN) where vehicles and adjacent infrastructure merge with traditional internet clouds to offer different applications ranging from low sized applications to very complex applications. VCN is composed of three types of clouds: Vehicular cloud, Infrastructure cloud and traditional Back-End (IT) cloud. We introduced these clouds via a three tier architecture along with their operations and characteristics. We have proposed use cases of each cloud tier that explain how it is practically created and utilised while taking the vehicular mobility in consideration. Moreover, it is critical to ensure security, privacy and trust of VCN network and its assets. Therefore, to describe the security of VCN, we have provided an in-depth analysis of different threats related to each tier of VCN. The threats related to vehicular cloud and infrastructure cloud are categorized according to their assets, i.e., vehicles, adjacent infrastructure, wireless communication, vehicular messages, and vehicular cloud threats. Similarly, the Back-End cloud threats are categorized into data and network threats. The possible implications of these threats and their effects on various components of VCN are also explained in detail.},

However, malicious nodes may take advantages of VC weak protection and present threats to their data, resources and services. We study the problem of the malicious nodes in VC and we propose a secure framework that leverages keys management and revocation mechanisms to protect VC against malicious nodes. The framework uses multiple zone authorities, where each one controls a zone (area) consists of road side units (RSUs), vehicles and the clients at that zone. Each zone authority works as a gateway that authenticates the operations of that zone, controls the services' requested and the data flow, and finally preserves the privacy of the vehicles, the clients and the cloud entities involved. Revocation mechanisms are used to generate revoked lists of malicious vehicles and clients implemented using skip lists. The framework efficiently prevents malicious nodes from using the vehicular cloud in light, secure and efficient way.},

In this paper, we propose a secure architecture of inter-vehicle communication which is obtained from a cloud services, including architecture level, communication level and associated security challenges. With the help of these cloud services, real time vehicle simulations are conducted to find the optimal route from a given source to the destination based on some factors such as distance, road width, traffic count, junction delay and velocity - all of which play an essential role in minimizing the travel time.

On the other hand, this study tackles one of the most important and conical attacks in cloud vehicle offering services, which is the Shrew attack. A number of steps should be taken first in order to explore these attacks like activating a loss-based probe to identify the locations and capabilities of the current bottlenecks, making use the data centers low-tenancy in order to synchronize the attacks flow and analyzing the necessary and the sufficient traffic for an effective attack.},

abstract={Cloud-assisted vehicular delay tolerant networks (DTNs) have been utilized in wide-ranging applications where a continuous end-to-end connection is unavailable, the message transmission is fulfilled by the cooperation among vehicular nodes and follows a store-carry-and-forward manner, and the complex computational work can be delegated to the disengaged vehicles in the parking lots which constitute the potential vehicular cloud. Nevertheless, the existing incentive schemes as well as the packet forwarding protocols cannot well model continuous vehicle collaboration, resist vehicle compromise attacks and collusion attacks, leaving the privacy preservation issues untouched. In this paper, a novel threshold credit-based incentive mechanism (TCBI) is proposed based on the modified model of population dynamics to efficiently resist the node compromise attacks, stimulate the cooperation among intermediate nodes, maximize vehicular nodes' interest, and realize the fairness of possessing the same opportunity of transmitting packets for credits. Then, a TCBI-based privacy-preserving packet forwarding protocol is proposed to solve the open problem of resisting layer-adding attack by outsourcing the privacy-preserving aggregated transmission evidence generation for multiple resource-constrained vehicles to the cloud side from performing any one-way trapdoor function only once. The vehicle privacy is well protected from both the cloud and transportation manager. Finally, formal security proof and the extensive simulation show the effectiveness of our proposed TCBI in resisting the sophisticated attacks and the efficiency in terms of high reliability, high delivery ratio, and low average delay in cloud-assisted vehicular DTNs.},

Then, we systematically construct a novel protocol that enables the cloud to smartly detect numerous potential attacks originating from malicious vehicles, without jeopardizing the privacy of benign vehicles. To guarantee that the construction is transparent to the delay in vehicle ad hoc networks, we propose an enhanced scheme wherein the attack detection frequency is tunable to any system requirements.

abstract={Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) have a great potential to improve road safety, traffic jams, fuel consumption, and to increase passenger convenience in vehicles. However, VANETs use an open medium for communication and, therefore, are exposed to security threats that influence their reliability. We propose a data-trust security model designed for VANETs based on social network theories. Drivers receiving data about traffic congestion or safety warnings can use the model to evaluate the trust in the received information. The model computes a trust index for each message based on the relevance of the event. It also uses a gossiping approach to disseminate data-trust indexes between vehicles, increasing the accuracy in the trustworthiness of an event and assuring the privacy by hiding the original event sources. The approach is evaluated through modeling and simulation, and we present results that proof its validity.},

abstract={Vehicular sensors able to perceive and measure the environment, ranging from in-vehicle sensors to speed cameras, are revolutionizing how technology can interact with our daily lives, enabling Intelligent Vehicular Systems (IVSs). These sensors generate large volumes of data which can reveal useful information for enhancing the sustainable development (through improved utilization of resources), as well as the safety and functionality of the system. In this context, a key challenge is to reduce the large data streams into manageable sets of valuable information in a real-time, reliable and cost-affordable fashion. Due to the data volume size and velocity, relying exclusively on traditional data processing systems, such as databases and batch processing, is no longer a suitable option, since it is not feasible to store the data to later process it. Moreover, careful decisions should be made to leverage the existing computing capacity, from embedded devices found in the IVSs to cloud infrastructures. In this paper we study trade-offs of possible options for data-stream processing models and computing infrastructures. Through building an experimental platform that emulates realistic components of a future deployable IVS and validating two different data-stream processing systems with a wellknown benchmark for IVSs, we study options and trade-offs in real-time data stream processing in IVS infrastructures. Our evaluation shows that existing data-stream processing models can be leveraged in different ways, based on the processing requirements.},

Fog services, including computation, storage, and networking, are hosted in the vicinity of end users (edge of the network), and, as a result, reliable access is provisioned to delay-sensitive mobile applications. However, in some cases, the fog computing capacity is overwhelmed by the growing number of demands from patrons, particularly during peak hours, and this can subsequently result in acute performance degradation. In this article, we address this problem by proposing a new concept called fog vehicular computing (FVC) to augment the computation and storage power of fog computing. We also design a comprehensive architecture for FVC and present a number of salient applications. The result of implementation clearly shows the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. Finally, some open issues and envisioned directions are discussed for future research in the context of FVC.},

abstract={With the emergence of in-vehicle applications, providing the required computational capabilities is becoming a crucial problem. This paper proposes a framework named autonomous vehicular edge (AVE) for edge computing on the road, with the aim of increasing the computational capabilities of vehicles in a decentralized manner. By managing the idle computational resources on vehicles and using them efficiently, the proposed AVE framework can provide computation services in dynamic vehicular environments without requiring particular infrastructures to be deployed. Specifically, this paper introduces a workflow to support the autonomous organization of vehicular edges. Efficient job caching is proposed to better schedule jobs based on the information collected on neighboring vehicles, including GPS information. A scheduling algorithm based on ant colony optimization is designed to solve this job assignment problem. Extensive simulations are conducted, and the simulation results demonstrate the superiority of this approach over competing schemes in typical urban and highway scenarios.},

To further reduce the latency and the transmission cost of the computation off-loading, we propose a cloud-based mobileedge computing (MEC) off-loading framework in vehicular networks. In this framework, we study the effectiveness of the computation transfer strategies with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication modes. Considering the time consumption of the computation task execution and the mobility of the vehicles, we present an efficient predictive combination-mode relegation scheme, where the tasks are adaptively off-loaded to the MEC servers through direct uploading or predictive relay transmissions. Illustrative results indicate that our proposed scheme greatly reduces the cost of computation and improves task transmission efficiency.},

  abstract = {With the emergence of ever-growing advanced vehicular applications, the challenges to meet the demands from both communication and computation are increasingly prominent. Without powerful communication and computational support, various vehicular applications and services will still stay in the concept phase and cannot be put into practice in the daily life. Thus, solving this problem is of great importance. The existing solutions, such as cellular networks, roadside units (RSUs), and mobile cloud computing, are far from perfect because they highly depend on and bear the cost of additional infrastructure deployment. Given tremendous number of vehicles in urban areas, putting these underutilized vehicular resources into use offers great opportunity and value. Therefore, we conceive the idea of utilizing vehicles as the infrastructures for communication and computation, named vehicular fog computing (VFC), which is an architecture that utilizes a collaborative multitude of end-user clients or near-user edge devices to carry out communication and computation, based on better utilization of individual communication and computational resources of each vehicle. By aggregating abundant resources of individual vehicles, the quality of services and applications can be enhanced greatly. In particular, by discussing four types of scenarios of moving and parked vehicles as the communication and computational infrastructures, we carry on a quantitative analysis of the capacities of VFC. We unveil an interesting relationship among the communication capability, connectivity, and mobility of vehicles, and we also find out the characteristics about the pattern of parking behavior, which benefits from the understanding of utilizing the vehicular resources. Finally, we discuss the challenges and open problems in implementing the proposed VFC system as the infrastructures. Our study provides insights for this novel promising paradigm, as well as research topics about vehicular informa- ion infrastructures.},

abstract={The developments of connected vehicles are heavily influenced by information and communications technologies, which have fueled a plethora of innovations in various areas, including networking, caching and computing. Nevertheless, these important enabling technologies have traditionally been studied separately in the existing works on vehicular networks. In this paper, we propose an integrated framework that can enable dynamic orchestration of networking, caching and computing resources to improve the performance of next generation vehicular networks. We formulate the resource allocation strategy in this framework as a joint optimization problem, where the gains of not only networking but also caching and computing are taken into consideration in the proposed framework. The complexity of the system is very high when we jointly consider these three technologies. Therefore, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach in this paper. Simulation results with different system parameters are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract  = {The increasing demand for mobile data is overloading the cellular infrastructure. Small cells and edge caching is being explored as an alternative, but installation and maintenance costs for sufficient coverage are significant. In this work, we perform a preliminary study of an alternative architecture based on two main ideas: (i) using vehicles as mobile caches that can be accessed by user devices; compared to small cells, vehicles are more widespread and require lower costs; (ii) combining the mobility of vehicles with delayed content access to increase the number of cache hits (and reduce the load on the infrastructure). Contrary to standard DTN-type approaches, in our system max delays are guaranteed to be kept to a few minutes (beyond this deadline, the content is fetched from the infrastructure). We first propose an analytical framework to compute the optimal number of content replicas that one should cache, in order to minimize the infrastructure load. We then investigate how to optimally refresh these caches to introduce new contents, as well as to react to the temporal variability in content popularity. Simulations suggest that our vehicular cloud considerably reduces the infrastructure load in urban settings, assuming modest penetration rates and tolerable content access delays.},

abstract={Internet of Things is smartly changing various existing research areas into new themes, including smart health, smart home, smart industry, and smart transport. Relying on the basis of “smart transport,” Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is evolving as a new theme of research and development from vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). This paper presents a comprehensive framework of IoV with emphasis on layered architecture, protocol stack, network model, challenges, and future aspects. Specifically, following the background on the evolution of VANETs and motivation on IoV an overview of IoV is presented as the heterogeneous vehicular networks. The IoV includes five types of vehicular communications, namely, vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-roadside, vehicle-to-infrastructure of cellular networks, vehicle-to-personal devices, and vehicle-to-sensors. A five layered architecture of IoV is proposed considering functionalities and representations of each layer. A protocol stack for the layered architecture is structured considering management, operational, and security planes. A network model of IoV is proposed based on the three network elements, including cloud, connection, and client. The benefits of the design and development of IoV are highlighted by performing a qualitative comparison between IoV and VANETs. Finally, the challenges ahead for realizing IoV are discussed and future aspects of IoV are envisioned.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate an energy efficiency issue for multimedia applications in a vehicular cloud environment. The problem of energy efficiency is formulated as a stochastic reward nets (SRNs)-based coalition game, in which vehicles are assumed as the players that formulate the coalition among themselves using a predefined criteria based on the demand generated and the available resources at the nearest cloudlet. A demand- and supply-based payoff value function is formulated for each player in the game. The processes and actions of the players are represented as SRNs in which each player should have a finite number of tokens to fire its actions. To reduce the delay, each vehicle accesses resources such as memory, processing power, and storage from the nearest cloudlet that may be either at the road side units deployed near the road or on the vehicles. The actions of the players are associated with a cardinality that represents the number of rewards and actions they have taken in a unit interval of time after interacting with an environment that is stochastic in this paper. For each action performed by the players, they may get feedback in the form of a reward or a penalty, according to which each player updates its action probability vector that helps them take the next actions in the game. An energy-efficient algorithm for frame scheduling using the nearest cloudlet is also proposed. The performance of the proposed algorithm is found to be satisfactory with respect to various evaluation metrics. In particular, there is an increment of 10%-15% in profit generation, with 20%-25% reduction in the delay, and an increment of 20% in the packet delivery ratio.},

  abstract = {Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength Ω becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system ω. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 × 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few (<;100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled (Ω/ω- ||},
