This respository describes the implementation details of Vehicle Telemetry data acquistion systems for my masther thesis.
Currently I have the following folders:

- **Particle**: describes the files/projects related to the Particle Electron OBD vehicle data acquisition system
- **josephvaner**: describes an implementation based on OBD bluetooth dongle and Raspberry Pi Zero
